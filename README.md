# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:
  
Pewlett-Hackard is a large company, consisting of several thousand employees.  It has been around for a long time.  As baby boomers begin to retire at a high-rate, Pewlett-Hackard is looking toward the future in two ways.  First, it is offering a retirement package for those that meet a certain criteria.  Second, it is starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in the near future.  The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of job openings.  This analysis helps the HR analyist answer two questions: who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions will need to be filled.  This analysis generates a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package.  This analysis uses SQL to built an employee database from six excel files.  

## Results:
